PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE: Solve D = A(3*B) *C^T

FILES: a short description of the purpose of each of the files, e.g. includes, source files, make file

hw8.cpp- Solves for D using the given equations and matrices utilizing classes, functions, and for loops

hw8.c- Solves for D using the given equations and matrices only utilizing for loops and functions.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS: Created a C and C++ file to solve the equation. Created functions for matrix mulitplication and matrix addition.

TESTING METHODOLOGY: Enter in the information for matrices A,B, and C and the files will both output D

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: "gcc hw8.c -o hw8" or "gcc hw8.cpp hw8" to compile
