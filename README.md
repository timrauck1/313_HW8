PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE: Creates matrices and does matrix equations involving matrix addition, matrix multiplication, and scalar matrix multiplication

FILES: 

hw8.cpp- Creates matrix objects with defined row and column size, allowing for matrix equations to be done on the matrices.

hw8.c- Creates matrix objects with defined row and column size, allowing for matrix equations to be done on the matrices.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS: 

C++- created a matrix class that creates matrix objects with integer values for column and row sizes. Then created functions that allow for the matrix equations to be done to the matrix objects.

C-

TESTING METHODOLOGY: Inputed the values for a,b, and c and did the matrix equations to create d, then printed out d to see if the equations were correct.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: "gcc -std=c99 hw8.c -o hw8" or "g++ hw8.cpp -o hw8" to compile
